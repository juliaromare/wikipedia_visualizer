Please use this file to answer the questions described in the readme:

1. In your own words describe the purpose of the LocalPage, LocalPageBox, and LocalPagePopularity classes. What do each of these represent and what is their purpose?

LocalPage holds information and specifies a Wikipedia page such as what Language it’s in, title and a specific ID.

LocalPageBox is a GCompound. It has instances of LocalPage, Color and a GRect. Its constructor sets these instance
instance variable by setting LocalPage and Color to two parameters and by creating a Grect which it then adds.
It has two instance methods to get the LocalPage associated with the LocalPageBox and to change the fillColor of the GRect.
Basically LocalPageBox is a GRect with a color which has an associated LocalPage with it.

LocalPagePopularity implements in the Comparable interface. It has two instance variables: a LocalPage and an integer.
The constructor sets the instance variables based on the input. It has three methods: two getter methods to get the
LocalPage and integer of the instance of the LocalPagePopularity. It also overrides the compareTo method to compare how
an input of an instance of LocalPagePopularity compares to this LocalPagePopularity. In short, LocalPagePopularity keeps
track of the popularity of a LocalPage and how it compares to other instances of LocalPage.


2. How do you get a single LocalPage for a specific article in a language?

The WikAPIdiaWrapper class has the method getLocalPageByTitle and returns a local page with a particular title.
Its inputs are a Language and a String, indicating the title.


3. How do you get all LocalPages in a language?

The WikAPIdiaWrapper class has the method getLocalPages which returns a List of LocalPage and ”returns a list of ALL the
local pages in a particular language.” The desired language is determined by input parameter.


4. Given a LocalPage in some Language (e.g. Apple in Simple English), how do you get the LocalPages in other languages linked to that LocalPage?

The WikAPIdiaWrapper class has the method getInOtherLanguages which takes in a LocalPage as a parameter. It ”returns a list
of the pages that represent the same concept in other languages”.


5. Are there any methods that help you understand the "popularity" of a LocalPage (hint: yes)?
Assuming that the popularity of an article is associated with how many other local pages that are linked to it, the WikAPIdiaWrapper
class’s method getLocalPageLinks ”returns a list of all the local pages in the same language that are linked to from a particular page.”
However, the PopularArticleAnalyzer class has the method getMostPopular() that returns the X most popular articles in a specified
language depending on its input. This method returns a list of these local pages.
